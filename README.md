## Professional experience

My adventure in IT started in July **2013** with internship in IT Consulting Department in AMG.net company. I applied mainly because of the interest in the real estate market (and one of the projects that needed help was strictly related) but soon I got really dragged into IT world. I spent ~4 years in this company working in multiple projects that concerned many areas: real estate market, customs, finance, UE fundings. My responsibilities included:
* day-to-day contact with developers and customers
* analyzing the requirements
* testing the applications
* preparing the documentation
* resolving support tickets. 

In my last project I worked on daily basis with SQL, querying the database and preparing repair scripts.
