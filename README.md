## Professional experience

My adventure in IT started in July **2013** with internship in IT Consulting Department in AMG.net company. I applied mainly because of the interest in the real estate market (and one of the projects that needed help was strictly related) but soon I got really dragged into IT world. I spent ~4 years in this company working in multiple projects that concerned many areas: real estate market, customs, finance, EU fundings. My responsibilities included:
* day-to-day contact with developers and customers
* analyzing the requirements
* testing the applications
* preparing the documentation
* resolving support tickets
* in my last project I worked on daily basis with SQL, querying the database and preparing repair scripts.

In my next company I switched to private sector and projects related to pharmaceutical industry. Apart from functional testing and business analysis, I gained some new experiences:
* working in the international team
* API testing with Postman and Swagger
* working in Scrum team
* writing user stories, managing backlog
* leading refinement sessions for bigger audience 
* carrying Product Owner's role for few months.
